# Test Case Management Features

The Test Case Manager now includes comprehensive management capabilities that enable teams to maintain control over test case evolution, track changes, and ensure quality through proper review processes.

## üöÄ Core Management Features

### 1. Test Case Versioning

**What it is:** A complete version control system for test cases that tracks every change, maintains history, and allows rollbacks.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Automatic Versioning**: Every change creates a new version with full audit trail
- **Version History**: Complete timeline of all changes with detailed changelogs
- **Change Tracking**: See exactly what was modified, added, or removed
- **Rollback Support**: Revert to previous versions when needed
- **Approval Workflow**: Versions can be marked as approved or pending

**How it works:**
1. When a test case is modified, a new version is automatically created
2. Each version includes:
   - Complete snapshot of the test case at that point
   - Changelog describing what changed
   - List of modified fields
   - Timestamp and author information
   - Approval status

**Benefits:**
- **Audit Compliance**: Full traceability of all changes
- **Quality Assurance**: Review process ensures changes are validated
- **Collaboration**: Multiple team members can work on test cases safely
- **Risk Management**: Easy rollback if issues are discovered

### 2. Change Request System

**What it is:** A formal process for proposing and reviewing changes to test cases before they're applied.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Proposal Creation**: Submit detailed change requests with reasons
- **Review Process**: Changes are reviewed by designated approvers
- **Approval Workflow**: Multi-stage approval process with comments
- **Change Tracking**: Full history of all proposed and applied changes
- **Priority Management**: Change requests can be prioritized

**How it works:**
1. **Create Request**: User proposes changes with detailed explanations
2. **Review Process**: Designated reviewers examine the proposed changes
3. **Approval/Rejection**: Changes are approved, rejected, or sent back for revision
4. **Implementation**: Approved changes are automatically applied and versioned

**Benefits:**
- **Quality Control**: All changes are reviewed before implementation
- **Team Collaboration**: Multiple stakeholders can provide input
- **Documentation**: Full record of why changes were made
- **Risk Mitigation**: Prevents problematic changes from being applied

### 3. Management Dashboard

**What it is:** A centralized interface for monitoring and managing all test case management activities.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Overview Tab**: High-level statistics and recent activity
- **Versions Tab**: Complete version history for all test cases
- **Change Requests Tab**: Manage pending and completed change requests
- **Settings Tab**: Configure management preferences and workflows

**Dashboard Features:**
- **Statistics Cards**: Quick view of key metrics
- **Recent Activity**: Latest changes and updates
- **Quick Actions**: Common management tasks
- **Filtering & Search**: Find specific items quickly

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Data Models

The system uses several new data models to support management features:

```typescript
// Test Case with versioning
interface TestCase {
  id: string
  version: number // Current version number
  // ... other fields
}

// Version history
interface TestCaseVersion {
  id: string
  testCaseId: string
  version: number
  data: Record<string, any>
  changelog: string
  changeType: 'create' | 'update' | 'revert' | 'status_change' | 'priority_change'
  changedFields: string[]
  createdAt: Date
  createdBy: string
  isApproved: boolean
  approvedBy?: string
  approvalDate?: Date
  comments?: VersionComment[]
}

// Change requests
interface TestCaseChangeRequest {
  id: string
  testCaseId: string
  requestedBy: string
  proposedChanges: Array<{
    field: string
    oldValue: any
    newValue: any
    reason: string
  }>
  status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected' | 'merged'
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Utility Functions

The system provides comprehensive utility functions for management operations:

- **`createTestCaseVersion()`**: Creates new versions when changes are made
- **`compareVersions()`**: Compares two versions to identify differences
- **`createChangeRequest()`**: Creates formal change requests
- **`applyChangeRequest()`**: Applies approved changes and creates new versions
- **`canRevertToVersion()`**: Checks if a version can be reverted to
- **`generateChangelog()`**: Creates human-readable change summaries

### UI Components

Several new React components provide the user interface:

- **`VersionHistory`**: Displays complete version history with expandable details
- **`ChangeRequestModal`**: Interface for creating new change requests
- **`ChangeRequestList`**: Management interface for reviewing change requests
- **`Tabs`**: Tabbed interface for organizing management features
